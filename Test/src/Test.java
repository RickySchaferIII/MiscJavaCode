/**
* Overview: Examine the three types of errors encountered in Java
Programs
* Input: None
* Output: Text Display * Variables: None
* Plan:
* 1. User runs the program
* 2. An error should display based on the introduced errors

public class Test{
	
 /* a. Changed Test to test
* Prediction: A compile error
* Error type (if any): Compile time error
* Error message from the compiler (if any):Unresolved compilation @line 4

		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("An emergency Broadcast");
		/* b. Changed Emergency to emergency
		* Prediction:I do not think this will cause an issue because it is going to be printed*/
		/* c. Removed the first quotation mark in the string
		 * Prediction: I think this will cause a syntax error
		 * Error type (if any):Syntax error
			d. Removed the last quotation mark in the string
		 * Prediction: I think this will cause a syntax error
		 * Error type (if any):Syntax error
		 	e. Removed the last quotation mark in the string
		 * Prediction: I think this will cause a syntax error
		 * Error type (if any):Syntax error
		 * f. Change main to man
		 * Prediction: I believe it will not find the main method
		 * Error type: logical
		 *  Error message: The main method could not be found.
 			f. Change println to bogus
		 * 	Prediction: I think that an error will pop up because bogus does not exist
		 *Error type: Syntax
		 * Error message: The compiler produces an error that says method bogus is not found in class java.io.PrintStream.
		 *g.Remove the semicolon at the end of the println statement
		 *Prediction: I think the program will create an error about the missing semicolon
		 *Error type: Syntax
		 *Error message:The Program produces an error saying that there is a semicolon missing at the end of the println statement.
		 *h. Remove the last brace in the program
		 *Prediction: The program will not run and produce an error in refernece to the brace
		 *Error type: Syntax
		 *Error message: The Program produces an error message that there should be a brace at the end of the program.
